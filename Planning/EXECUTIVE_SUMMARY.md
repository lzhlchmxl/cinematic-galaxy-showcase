Executive Summary — Cinematic Galaxy Showcase
🎯 Purpose

Create a one-page static site that showcases a curated set of founder friends and their projects in a cinematic, interactive galaxy experience. The site is designed as a personal branding piece to highlight Bill Liang’s technical and creative engineering skills.

Success Metric: A LinkedIn post featuring the project garners 30+ likes through engagement from founders, peers, and the broader tech community.

✨ Concept Overview

Theme: “Each founder is a star in the galaxy — connected through engineering and imagination.”

Experience: Visitors enter a 3D cosmic environment where glowing planets represent founders. Users can freely orbit around the galaxy using their mouse/trackpad (planetarium-style navigation). Clicking on a planet reveals a founder spotlight with details about their project.

Branding: Concludes with a constellation that forms “Crafted by Bill Liang”, leaving a signature visual mark.
