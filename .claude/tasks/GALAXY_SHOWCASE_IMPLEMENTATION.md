## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                  # Start dev server
npm run build               # Production build
npm run preview             # Preview build locally

# Code Quality (Once setup)
npm run lint                # ESLint check
npm run type-check          # TypeScript validation
npm run test                # Test suite
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance on mobile**: Use conditional rendering and quality scaling
2. **Bundle size**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
3. **Browser compatibility**: Target modern browsers, provide fallbacks

### Timeline Risks
1. **Complex 3D math**: Start with simplified positioning, enhance iteratively
2. **Visual effects**: Build basic version first, add polish incrementally
3. **Data collection**: Use placeholder data initially, real data in Phase 3

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- [ ] 60 FPS on desktop, 30 FPS on mobile
- [ ] <3 second initial load time
- [ ] <2MB total bundle size
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Business
- [ ] LinkedIn post with embedded video/screenshots
- [ ] 30+ likes from founder network and tech community
- [ ] Demonstrates Bill's technical and creative skills
- [ ] Serves as conversation starter for networking

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** - Ensure alignment with vision and timeline
2. **Initialize project** - Set up Vite + React + TypeScript foundation
3. **Build incrementally** - Focus on getting basic 3D scene working first
4. **Test early and often** - Validate performance and UX continuously

This plan balances ambition with pragmatism, ensuring we deliver a stunning showcase while maintaining realistic timelines and technical feasibility.
